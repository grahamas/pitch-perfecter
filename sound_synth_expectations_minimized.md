`sound_synth` should provide an API to generate synthetic audio signals (Vec<f32>), including sine waves, voice-like signals (with harmonics, vibrato, envelope), and noise (white, pink, brown). All functions must accept sample rate, duration, and amplitude parameters. Output should be compatible with audio analysis (e.g., pitch detection, FFT). The package should be lightweight, well-documented, and easy to use.
