## Integration Expectations

- All generated signals should be compatible with downstream audio analysis and processing modules (e.g., pitch detection, FFT).
- The package should be lightweight, with minimal dependencies.
- Functions should be well-documented and tested.

## Summary

`sound_synth` should provide a clear, parameterized API for generating synthetic audio signals, with a focus on voice-like and musical test signals, noise generation, and flexibility for both batch and real-time use cases.
